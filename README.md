Monsterz is an arcade puzzle game, similar to the popular
Zookeper/Bejeweled games.

The goal of the game is to create straight lines of the same monster
directly next to each other, either horizontally or vertically, by
swapping adjacent monsters.

Swapping is only allowed if it results in a line of three or more
monsters. They disappear and any monsters that were on top of them
fall down, possibly creating a chain reaction of more disappearing
monsters.

There are three modes:

* Classic: Play against a time limit to clear a given number of each
  monster type to reach the next level. Clearing monster gives you
  more time.

* Puzzle: Time passes more slowly. There are special block tiles which
  you have to match together to pass to the next level.

* Training Mode: choose the number of different monsters and the
  difficulty.
